Dynamic Routing Protocols 
IGP AND EGP : Interior Gateway Protocol and External Gateway Protocol
IGP: within the autonomous system
EGP: between the autonomous system

RIP	:IGP
BGP	:EGP	
OSPF	:IGP

Dynamic routing protocols are used to learn all the routes, to learn all the paths to reach all the networks and to select the best path to reach all the networks.

further classifications

classful address: address with its default mask

classless address: address with other mask but not with default mask.

classful routing protocol: mask not send as the part of update , they will automatically summarize at classful boundary.(like 10.10.10.0---class A address )

More chances to choose the sub-optimal paths by routing protocols if find two similar classful boundary in the routing table.Problem solved by Classless Routing protocols.

classless routing protocl: mask send as the part of update .
